  abstract = "signatureSearch is an R/Bioconductor package that integrates a
              suite of existing and novel algorithms into an analysis
              environment for gene expression signature (GES) searching
              combined with functional enrichment analysis (FEA) and
              visualization methods to facilitate the interpretation of the
              search results. In a typical GES search (GESS), a query GES is
              searched against a database of GESs obtained from large numbers
              of measurements, such as different genetic backgrounds, disease
              states and drug perturbations. Database matches sharing
              correlated signatures with the query indicate related cellular
              responses frequently governed by connected mechanisms, such as
              drugs mimicking the expression responses of a disease. To
              identify which processes are predominantly modulated in the GESS
              results, we developed specialized FEA methods combined with
              drug-target network visualization tools. The provided analysis
              tools are useful for studying the effects of genetic, chemical
              and environmental perturbations on biological systems, as well as
              searching single cell GES databases to identify novel network
              connections or cell types. The signatureSearch software is unique
              in that it provides access to an integrated environment for
              GESS/FEA routines that includes several novel search and
              enrichment methods, efficient data structures, and access to
              pre-built GES databases, and allowing users to work with custom
              databases.",

               prescribe an unattainable fixed significance level. The use of

              constitutive non-equivalence of various genes within a defined
              pathway. We here designed a network-based method to determine
              such non-equivalence in terms of gene weights. The gene weights
              determined are biologically consistent and robust to network
              perturbations. By integrating the gene weights into the classical
              gene set analysis, with a subsequent correction for the
              ``over-counting'' bias associated with multi-subunit proteins, we
              have developed a novel gene-weighed pathway analysis approach, as
              implemented in an R package called ``Gene Associaqtion

              several microarray datasets, including the p53 dataset, asthma

              our approach is biologically reliable and reproducible, and

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Interpretation of high-throughput genomics data based on
              biological pathways constitutes a constant challenge, partly
              because of the lack of supporting pathway database. In this
              study, we created a functional genomics knowledgebase in mouse,
              which includes 33,261 pathways and gene sets compiled from 40
              sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG, GeneSetDB, PANTHER, microRNA
              and transcription factor target genes, etc. In addition, we also
              manually collected and curated 8,747 lists of differentially
              expressed genes from 2,526 published gene expression studies to
              enable the detection of similarity to previously reported gene
              expression signatures. These two types of data constitute a Gene
              Set Knowledgebase (GSKB), which can be readily used by various
              pathway analysis software such as gene set enrichment analysis
              (GSEA). Using our knowledgebase, we were able to detect the
              correct microRNA (miR-29) pathway that was suppressed using
              antisense oligonucleotides and confirmed its role in inhibiting
              fibrogenesis, which might involve upregulation of transcription
              factor SMAD3. The knowledgebase can be queried as a source of
              published gene lists for further meta-analysis. Through
              meta-analysis of 56 published gene lists related to retina cells,
              we revealed two fundamentally different types of gene expression
              changes. One is related to stress and inflammatory response
              blamed for causing blindness in many diseases; the other
              associated with visual perception by normal retina cells. GSKB is
              available online at http://ge-lab.org/gs/, and also as a
              Bioconductor package (gskb,
              https://bioconductor.org/packages/gskb/). This database enables
              in-depth interpretation of mouse genomics data both in terms of
              known pathways and the context of thousands of published
              expression signatures.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The biological phenotype of a cell, such as a
              characteristic visual image or behavior, reflects activities
              derived from the expression of collections of genes. As such, an
              ability to measure the expression of these genes provides an
              opportunity to develop more precise and varied sets of
              phenotypes. However, to use this approach requires computational
              methods that are difficult to implement and apply, and thus there
              is a critical need for intelligent software tools that can reduce
              the technical burden of the analysis. Tools for gene expression
              analyses are unusually difficult to implement in a user-friendly
              way because their application requires a combination of
              biological data curation, statistical computational methods, and
              database expertise. RESULTS: We have developed SIGNATURE, a
              web-based resource that simplifies gene expression signature
              analysis by providing software, data, and protocols to perform
              the analysis successfully. This resource uses bayesian methods
              for processing gene expression data coupled with a curated
              database of gene expression signatures, all carried out within a
              GenePattern web interface for easy use and access. CONCLUSIONS:
